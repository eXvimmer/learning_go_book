/* NOTE:
 * You need to properly handle closed channels. If one of the cases in a select
 * is reading a closed channel, it will always be successful, returning the
 * zero value. Every time that case is selected, you need to check to make sure
 * that the value is valid and skip the case. If reads are spaced out, your
 * program is going to waste a lot of time reading junk values. When that
 * happens, we rely on something that looks like an error: reading a nil
 * channel. Reading from or writing to a nil channel causes your code to hang
 * forever. While that is bad if it is triggered by a bug, you can use a nil
 * channel to disable a case in a select. When you detect that a channel has
 * been closed, set the channelâ€™s variable to nil. The associated case will no
 * longer run, because the read from the nil channel never returns a value:
